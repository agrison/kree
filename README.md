# Kree

Kree is a minimalistic Eclipse plugin to show an indentation guide in text files. It aims firstly at Java code, or C-brace-style code, but it should work for languages clearly indented (Python, Ruby, you name it).

It has been a long time since I first read on eclipse forums that a small feature like this is planned, but it isn't out yet.
That's why I made this plugin, in order to learn and because sometimes it can be useful to see clearly the indentation through the code.

# About the name

I like the Stargate universe a lot, I needed a name, here it is. 
*Kree* means a lot of things in [Goa'uld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa'uld), since it's a fictionnal language, it could even means *Show me the indentation, you Sholva*.

# Todos

Preference pane for setting guide colors (cycle)
Highlighting parens with different colors (if = green, else = blue, ...; ala CodeKana)
More features, less bugs.
